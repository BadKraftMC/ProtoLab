## ProtoLab.OpenTest  
 - [*Home*](../README.md)  

*OpenTest* is intended to be a minimalist testing framework. Development has focused on ease of use in cross-platform environments.  
There are two libraries in the *OpenTest* component:  
 - OpenTest (executable)
 - OpenTest.Lib

Execution is initiated by passing the executable a parameter for the target *.dll*.

**How to ...(*VS Code*)**  
 - Basic Unit Testing
   Open a new project (we are using *VS Code*) and reference the *OpenTest.Lib* library. Create a class and decorate a method for testing. (*see below*)  

   ```c#
    public class TestContainer
    {
        private List<object> objList;

        // This is a basic unit test.
        [TestCase]
        public void ObjectIsNull()
        {
            objList = null;
            Assert.IsNull(objList);
        }
    }
   ```
 - launch.json
 This is how I launch from *VS Code*:
 ```json
    {
        "name": "Launch SM Dev 02",
        "type": "coreclr",
        "request": "launch",
        "preLaunchTask": "build SM Dev 02",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/bin/testing/OpenTest",
        "args": [
            "-s SM_Dev_02"
        ],
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/bin/testing",
        "console": "internalConsole",
        "stopAtEntry": false
    }
 ```
 Other *VS Code* considerations...
 Configure the compiler to write output *.dlls* to a bin directory under the workspace directory to simplify using directories, references, etc.  
 Here are the ***OpenTest*** and one other sample compile task:
 ```json
     {
        "label": "build OpenTest",
        "type": "process",
        "group": "build",
        "command": "dotnet",
        "args": [
            "build",
            "${workspaceFolder}/src/lib/opentest/ProtoLab.OpenTest.csproj",
            "/property:GenerateFullPaths=true",
            "-o",
            "${workspaceFolder}/bin/testing"
        ],
        "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
    },
    {
        "label": "build SM Dev 02",
        "type": "process",
        "group": "build",
        "command": "dotnet",
        "args": [
            "build",
            "${workspaceFolder}/src/dev/SM_Dev_02/SM_Dev_02.csproj",
            "/property:GenerateFullPaths=true",
            "-o",
            "${workspaceFolder}/bin/testing/SM_Dev_02"
        ],
        "problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
    }
 ```
  
There are several samples to read through to see how simple unit testing can and should be. (*[Sample](../main/src/dev/SM_Dev_02/ObjectTests.cs)*)

There is only one decorator attribute (*at the moment*) - **`TestCase`**. You can use this decorator on each method you intend to put under test. For now, any method to be the target of testing must be parameterless.

***Works in Progress***
I am currently working on creating a very robust and extensible unit test framework. All ideas are welcome.
