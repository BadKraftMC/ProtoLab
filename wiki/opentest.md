## ProtoLab.OpenTest  
 - [*Home*](../README.md)  

*OpenTest* is intended to be a minimalist testing framework. Development has focused on ease of use in cross-platform environments.  
There are two libraries in the *OpenTest* component:  
 - OpenTest (executable)
 - OpenTest.Lib

Execution is initiated by passing the executable a parameter for the target *.dll*.

**How to ...(*VS Code*)**  
 - Basic Unit Testing
   Open a new project (we are using *VS Code*) and reference the *OpenTest.Lib* library. Create a class and decorate a method for testing. (*see below*)  

   ```c#
    public class TestContainer
    {
        private List<object> objList;

        [TestCase(ignore: false)]
        public void ObjectIsNull()
        {
            objList = null;
            Assert.IsNull(objList);
        }
    }
   ```
  This is a basic unit test. There are several samples to read through to see how simple unit testing can and should be. (*[Sample]*(main/src/dev/SM_Dev_02/ObjectTests.cs))

  There is only one decorator attribute (*at the moment*) - **`TestCase`**. You can use this decorator on each method you intend to put under test. For now, any method to be the target of testing must be parameterless.

  ***Works in Progress***
  We care currently working on creating a very robust and extensible unit testing framework. All ideas are welcome.
